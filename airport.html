		<h3>Improving Efficiency</h3>

		<p>There are many different ways in which technology and computing has helped make airports

		 very efficient. In 2017, Heathrow airports air transport movemements was just under

		 <strong>1300</strong> a day on average, thus requiring many computing systems to allow the 

		safe arrival and departure of over <strong>200,000</strong> people a day going through the airport.

		<br /><br />The first way in which computing has helped the efficiency is <em>Flight Information Display

		Systems (FIDS).</em> These are the boards which appear in airports to give passengers up to date

		information about their flight; including flight information (number, time and destination), gate number 

		and whether its delayed.

		<br /><br />The second way that computing has improved efficiency is through the new Biometric Passports.

		These allow people to go through passport control with facial recognition as opposed to queueing for 

		an officer to check the passport.

		<br /><br />Lastly with regards to improving efficiency, is Air Traffic Control. Arguably, in terms of

		the number of flights into and out of an airport, this is the most fundamental element as computers now

		are able to find the maximum number of flights that can take off/land safetly in a given amount of time.

		Not only this, but they also have to accomodate for delays, and thus rescheduling of take off/landing times.</p>

		<h3>Improving Safety</h3>

		<p>Safety is hugely important with regards to air travel as accidents are very likely to be devasting due to the speed

		and height that planes fly. The first way in which airports try to be as safe as possible is through <em>X-Ray machines</em>.

		These check the contents of people's hand luggage to ensure nothing boards the plane that could cause an accident. 

		<br></br>Secondly, and closely related to X-Ray machines, is <em>full body scanners</em>, which simarily check that the clothes 

		and items someone has on their body are safe to board the plane. <br></br>Finally, is <em>Air traffic control</em>, which as already

		mentioned as being a method to improve efficiency, is highly important when dealing with safety. This helps to ensure

		that no two planes are taking off or landing at the same time.</p>
